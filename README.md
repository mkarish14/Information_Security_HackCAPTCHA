# CECS-579---Hack-CAPTCHA
Motivation

A CAPTCHA is abbreviated from "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" (http://www.captcha.net/, 2000). An image of randomly scrambled letters is dynamically created. Since these letters are a part of an image and not text, it becomes difficult for a spam bot or other computer program to read. On the contrary it also has little trouble reading the letters in a captcha image. Since it is difficult task to break the CAPTCHA, it would be challenging to break the CAPTCHA. There are various algorithms developed to break CAPTCHA. One of those include Naïve Pattern Matching algorithm. In this project, I am looking forward to implement this algorithm.

Proposed Solution

In the naïve pattern matching algorithm, the CAPTCHA is first preprocessed which results in segmentation of characters, and these characters are then recognized based on its specific features. The breaking of CAPTCHA will in turn helps to develop more robust

Goals:
    
    1. To perform pre-processing on input CATCHA Image
    2. To segment the characters in the image since It is difficult for the characters to be identified if those characters are joined
    3.  Implement specific feature extraction module which will help to recognize difference between letters. There are  specific features which differentiate well between characters.
    4. Implement character recognition logic.
    5. Implement two CAPTCHA breaking known algorithms
    6. Test the code against wide range of input data set
    7. Iterate false positives and false negatives
